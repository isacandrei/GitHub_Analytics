## Github Analytics

----------------------------------------

The main scope of the application is to aid professors in grading student projects uploaded in GitHub repositories. The application uses the GitHub API to request data such as, language, commit counts and contributors, for all the projects the user wants to grade. Apache Spark uses a small dataset to train the regression model used to predict the future projects grades. Authorization, project selection and presentation of the results are made through a web interface, developed using Scala and Play Framework.
